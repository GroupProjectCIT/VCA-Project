			<h1>About Us:</h1><b>Virtual Care Assistant (VCA)</b><br>
			With advances in modern medicine, less people in the developed 
			world are dying from the traditional killers of heart disease and cancer. 
			As a consequence, people are now living longer. However the benefits of 
			old age has brought new challenges and we have witnessed an explosion 
			in the incidence of Alzheimer's and dementia. In America alone, it is 
			estimated that 5.5 million people are currently living with the disease.
			<br><br>
			We provide a traditional service of providing human care assistants to the elderly.
			Our website acts as a control centre for companies involved in the provision of 
			in-home care.<br>
			On our app, it is more than a tool, but is more like a friend.
			It is always there for the user. It can help you stay focused with activities
			like memory skills, calendar playback, location aware and much more.
			<br><br>
			If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to visit our contact page
			below and send us a message.

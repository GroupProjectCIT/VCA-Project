    <h1>About Us:</h1><b>Virtual Care Assistant (VCA)</b><br>
    With advances in modern medicine, less people in the developed
    world are dying from the traditional killers of heart disease and cancer.
    As a consequence, people are now living longer. However the benefits of
    old age has brought new challenges and we have witnessed an explosion
    in the incidence of Alzheimer's and dementia. In America alone, it is
    estimated that 5.5 million people are currently living with the disease.
    <br><br>
    We provide a traditional service of providing human care assistants to the elderly.
    Our website acts as a control centre for companies involved in the provision of
    in-home care.<br>
    On our app, it is more than a tool, but is more like a friend.
    It is always there for the user. It can help you stay focused with activities
    like memory skills, calendar playback, location aware and much more.
    <br><br>
